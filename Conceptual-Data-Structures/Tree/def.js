// A Tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
// A Tree is a non linear data structure, compared to arrays,linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.
// In linear data structure, the time require to search is proportional to the size of the data set.
// Trees however, owing to the nonlinear nature allows quicker and easier search access to the data.
// A tree will not contain any loops or cycles.
